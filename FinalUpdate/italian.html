  <h3>Italian Cooking</h3>
  <p>
    Italy is a place many people dream of. It's also the first place people tend to think of when it comes to
    pasta and vice versa. But Italy is much more than pasta, and this class will teach you about the other things that come from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Italian cuisine tends to tie closely into Mediterranean cuisines, but with a few differences, one being that
    they use more cured meats rather than fresh. In this class you will be learning to make things such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/mushroom-risotto-recipe-1938065">Risotto</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/gelato-alla-fragola-strawberry-gelato-recipe-1940417">Gelato</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/arancini-recipe-2111948">Arancini</a></li>
    <li>And, of course, different types of pasta</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Whether you're wanting a simple meal that will please the whole family or are wanting to impress a date by making some classics,
    you'll find what you're looking for in this class!
  </p>
  <h3>Pricing</h3>
  <p>The price of the class depends on the size of your group. 
    You may have a group of up to <strong>four</strong> people or you can attend solo!
    Our classes are designed so that whether you're by yourself or have a partner, you can still participate in the activity.
    We recommend you bring a partner, as it can be a very fun bonding experiance, but you don't have to!
