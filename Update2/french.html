  <h3>French Cooking</h3>
  <p>
    Ah, France. It's not an uncommon dream to wish to go to France, but alas, 
    not a lot of people can afford it. That, however, doesn't mean that you can't 
    learn how to make some dishes to have in the comfort of your own home!
  </p>
  <p>
    France is known for many elaborate dishes, and for good reason as 
    the culture tends to focus on longer, formal meals as social events.
    Some of the most common things associated with France are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Olive Oil (if you're closer to southern France)</li>
    <li>Butter/Cream (if closer to northern France)</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Wine (21 and up students only)</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A few dishes that come to mind as the most recognized would be French Macarons, Ratatouille, and Coq au Vin.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're looking to bring a part of France into your kitchen, this class is for you! And as a bonus with the holidays coming up, 
    we will, in fact, be having a class specially dedicated to making macarons! So be sure to sign up while spots are available!
