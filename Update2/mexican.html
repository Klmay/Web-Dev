  <h3>Mexican Cooking</h3>
  <p>
    Mexico is a very vibrant culture, with a strong focus on family, arts, 
    and celebrations or events like Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) in many places. With that,
    there are also plenty of regional cuisines that you can find there!
  </p>
  <p>
    In this class, you will be learning a variety of different cuisines that the country has to offer. 
    Some of these dishes may include:
