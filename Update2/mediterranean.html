  <h3>Mediterranean Cooking</h3>
  <p>
    When you think of the word "Mediterranean" what comes to mind? 
    For most people, the answer may be "fish" and you're on the right track, but that isn't the full story!
  </p>
  <p>
    Mediterranean cuisine focuses around the use of fresh vegetables, fruits, and seafood! 
    Some of the most common ingriedients you'll see are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Olive Oil (the most common primary fat used)</li>
    <li>Whole Grains (such as bread or pasta)</li>
    <li>Nuts</li>
    <li>Wine (21 and up students only)</li>
    <li>Lugumes</li>
    <li>Fruits</li>
    <li>Vegetables</li>
    <li>Fresh Herbs (classics such as basil, thyme, and oregano)</li>
    <li>Seafood</li>
    <li>Lamb</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    And that's not all! You'll have an oppurtunity to work with plenty of different dishes that use 
    a variety of different ingredients each week! So if you're looking for some new seafood dishes to make or simply want ideas for 
    how to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, come on in!
